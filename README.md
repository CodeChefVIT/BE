# DevSoc2019---TimeTable-App

## INTRODUCTION -

Framing a timetable for a semester in our campus is a daunting task, the student needs to not only avoid selecting overlapping slots, but also take faculties and subjects of their preference. Often, students find it near impossible to be able to meticulously calculate every possible scenario and frame a efficient timetable that is tailored for their preferences. If the preferred faculty or subject is offered, it ends up in the same slot or is in conflict with another chosen subject.

## ABSTRACT -

We plan to build a web app that will address the bimonthly problem / issue faced by students of VITC campus - the timetable selection process. The user will be able to select subjects and the faculties from the website, and they will also be able to provide preferences in the form of some quantifiable numbers for each subject and faculty. This data will be used and processed by our algorithm to list out all feasible yet favorable timetables and list them to the user. The user will then be able to view all the timetables and be able to incorporate one of those possible timetables as his own, for the next semester. The website design is planned to be minimal as possible, with a great UX.

We also plan to integrate a chatbot into the website to assist students with a few queries that they might have regarding the functioning of college and its rules and regulations. Currently, the modules that the chatbot should be able to handle will be -

1. Bus routes / stops and timing details
2. Curriculum requirements for every B.Tech. departments
